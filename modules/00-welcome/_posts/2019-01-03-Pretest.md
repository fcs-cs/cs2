# REThink Pretest

Last summer I participated in a summer research experience for teachers at Drexel Univeristy. As part of the experience I built a lesson plan based on the research that I was doing. We will be using that lesson plan later in the year, but before we get to that there is a quick [pre-survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/REThinkPre_HS_Student18-19) that they'd like to you take. Please take time now to do so.

# CS Pretest
As outlined in the opening page, there are a number of goals for this class divided into three main areas, abstract skills, concrete skills, and concepts. In order to chart your progress please take the time to fill out the survey below. We will revisit this a couple of times throughout the semester in order to chart your progress.
