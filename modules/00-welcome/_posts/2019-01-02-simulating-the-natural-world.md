Let's take some time to talk about what are goals are for this semester. As I see it, there are three different goals that we will be working on simultaneous. abstract skills, concrete skills, and concepts.

## Abstract skills
The first set of goals for this class is to develop a set of abstract skills that you can carry with you into different domains. These are the ability to:
- analyze
- deconstruct
- assess
- collaborate
- improve

## Concrete Skills
Concrete skills are related to know how when it comes to coding. The skills that we will address in this class are:
- git
- objects and classes
- lists and arrays
- ES6
- vectors
- strings

## Concepts
Conceptually we will examine:
- version control
- top down simulations
- bottom up simulations
- stochasticity
- Encoding and encryption
- Data Analysis

## Projects
We will address all of these areas of inquiry through projects. Many of them will be collaborative as the scope of these problems may be beyond the skills of any one person. Also, people rarely work in isolation and learning to collaborate on code is an extremely useful tool. The projects we will undertake are:
- Collaborative Poetry
  - git, version control, collaboration, improve
- Cellular Automata
  - deconstruct, assess, bottom up design, lists and arrays, ES6
- Hunter and Prey simulation
    - assess, bottom up design, classes and objects, stochasticity, data analysis
- Solar System Simulation
  - analyze, vectors, objects and classes, arrays, top down design
- Sending secrete messages
  - Encoding and encryption, strings, improve.
