# Let's Go!

In order to get started you will need to sign up for a couple of different services that we will be using throughout the semester.

## Google Classroom
The first one is [Google Classroom](http://classroom.google.com). You'll need to navigate over to the classroom landing page and add a new classroom and join a new class with the code

## [Github](http://www.github.com)
[Github](https://www.github.com) is an online version control platform used by many programmers, groups, startups, and businesses across the world. With this platform, keeping track of your code, sharing it with others, and collaboration is a breeze. This will be where we keep all of our code for the semester.

1. Navigate to [github](https://www.github.com) and signup for an account. For your user name I would recommend using the first part of your FCS email address if possible. If not, use something simple and descriptive. For your email, please use your FCS email.<br>

## Not optional - [Reflective Journal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2lwJSUII3sA34K1oSV23--1zmGNzt8fT5t7re55wSVcESjg/viewform)
Lastly, take a minute to tell me a little something about your previous experience with computers and coding. Some of you may have already seen this before in 8th grade, but I still want to know how your relationship with coding and computers has changed.
