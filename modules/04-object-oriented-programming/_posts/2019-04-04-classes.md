## In class assignment

In your fork of cs2-student-files navigate to OOP/object-classes/yourname. (If it's not there, make sure to pull in the updates from fcs-cs to your fork) There you will find a sketch of a bouncing ball written without using object classes. Refactor the code so that there is a `Ball` class that knows about its `x`, `y` and `r` and has at least three methods. After refactoring create at least two instances of the Ball class (`ball1` and `ball2`). When you have finished submit a pull request back to fcs-cs/cs2-student-files MASTER.
