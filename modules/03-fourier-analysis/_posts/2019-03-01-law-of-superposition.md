>“For all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually.”

What does this mean? Algebraically this can also be written that _f(x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>) = f(x<sub>1</sub>) + f(x<sub>2</sub>)_ or in otherwords the result of any two or more functions acting together is the sum of each of their actions. While this is true of any linear system, we're particullarly interested in the ways in which waves are summed together.

## What is sound?

Sound is a a pressure wave traveling through a medium, usually air. When that pressure wave is sinusoidal (like a wave) we perceive that as a tone. A pure tone is a wave propogating through space with a fixed frequency, or cycles per second. For example a soundwave with a frequency of 440hz is what we call an A in music. When two tones are played together they make a harmony. When the two waves are in ratio with eachother the harmony is pleasant, but if they are not it can sound dissonant. But how do we preceive those two waves?
