>Cellular automata are discrete dynamical systems with simple construction but complex self-organizing behaviour. Evidence is presented that all one-dimensional cellular automata fall into four distinct universality classes... The fourth class is probably capable of **universal computation**, so that properties of its infinite time behaviour are undecidable.

Cellular Automata (CA) is a type of **bottom up** simultion that has its roots in the 1940's with Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann. The basic concept is that of a simulation played out on a giant grid. At any time t<sub>n</sub> each cell of the grid can be either "on" or "off." Alive or dead. 0 or 1. In the next time step t<sub>n+1</sub> the sates of all of the cells in the grid are recalculated based on a set of rules, which are predefined ahead of time, and the state of the cell's neighbors.

Daniel Shiffman has a great explanation of Cellular Automata in his book ["The Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com). [Please read upto and including 7.2](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/)
