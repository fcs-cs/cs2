<p class = "caption"> John Conway is a British mathemetician who's interests include knot theory, number theory and combinatorics. Perhaps one of his best known contributions is in the field of cellular automata with something called the "Game of Life." Above is an example of some of the complexity that can be created with the Game of Life </p>


## Simple rules. Surprising results

The beauty of the Game of life is that the rules for the world are very simple, yet there is a surprising amount of complexity and variety that emerges. The following video shows some of the amazing things that have been created from the game of life. The following video from Daniel Shiffman helps to explain what the Game of Life is all about. You need watch only the first 8mins

## Reading
Read section [7.6 - Game of Life](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/) from Shiffman's Nature of Code

## In Class:

Go to [Game of Life](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/) and try playing around with the simulation. What do you notice? Can you predict the behavior of a configuration before the simulation starts?
