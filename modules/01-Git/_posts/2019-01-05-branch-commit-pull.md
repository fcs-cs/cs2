Now that we have a copy of our code on our computer and we have access to github via VS Code we can go ahead and start making our edits. 

1. **Branch** Branching is the process of creating a snapshot of a code repository at a particular point in time. This allows us to have the most up to date code, and then make changes and work on new ideas without worring about messing with our master code base. It is good practice **not** to make commits directly to the master branch, but rather to make a project branch and pull the changes in. 
2. **Commit** Once you have made a branch you can make all the changes you want to your branch of the code. When you're happy with your changes commit those changes to your branch. Make sure to use a good commit message.
3. **Pull Request** In order to begin the process of merging your changes from your branch back into master, you will need to make a pull request back to the master brach. 

This video will show you the process of branching, making changes and commiting, and creating a pull request all inside of VS Code.
