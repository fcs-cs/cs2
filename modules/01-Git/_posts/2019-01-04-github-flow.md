Git and Github are design to be flexible and suit the needs of individual coders and enterprise coders a like, which means that it can do **A LOT !** What that means is that its easy to get your self in to the weeds without making a lot of progress. Luckily, you're not the first person to use github, and there are some well established workflows that will help us all collaborate effectively with code. While there are many different workflows, in the class we will look at the basic "GitHub Flow"

The GitHub workflow has 6 steps to it, although we're only going to use 5. They are:

1. Branch
2. Make Changes
3. Make Pull Request
4. Discussion<br>
...Deploy (This is omitted in our case)
5. Merge

However, Before we get started there are a couple of important things that we have to do first.

### Cloning a Repository

Cloning a repo is the process by which you download a repository to your computer so that you can work on them locally. This is a pretty simple process which the video below will explain

Simple, eh?
