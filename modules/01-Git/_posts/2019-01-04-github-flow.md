# {{page.title}}

Git and Github are design to be flexible and suit the needs of individual coders and enterprise coders a like, which means that it can do **A LOT !** What that means is that its easy to get your self in to the weeds without making a lot of progress. Luckily, you're not the first person to use github, and there are some well established workflows that will help us all collaborate effectively with code. While there are many different workflows, in the class we will look at the basic "GitHub Flow"

The GitHub workflow has 5 steps

1. Branch
2. Make Changes
3. Make Pull Request
4. Discussion
5. Merge

There is a great explaination on [GitHub's website](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

However, Before we get started there are a couple of important things that we have to do first.

### [VSCode GitHub Pull Request Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)

> Review and manage your GitHub pull requests directly in VS Code

This extension allows you to review and manage GitHub pull requests in Visual Studio Code. The support includes:
- Authenticating and connecting VS Code to GitHub.
- Listing and browsing PRs from within VS Code.
- Reviewing PRs from within VS Code with in-editor commenting.
- Validating PRs from within VS Code with easy checkouts.
- Terminal integration that enables UI and CLIs to co-exist.

![Demo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/master/.readme/demo.gif?raw=true)

It's easy to get started with GitHub Pull Requests for Visual Studio Code. Simply follow these steps to get started.

1. Make sure you have VSCode version 1.27.0 or higher.
1. Download the extension from [the marketplace](https://aka.ms/vscodepr-download).
1. Reload VS Code after the installation (click the reload button next to the extension).
1. Open your desired GitHub repository.
1. Go to the SCM Viewlet, and you should see the `GitHub Pull Requests` treeview. On the first load, it will appear collapsed at the bottom of the viewlet.
1. A notification should appear asking you to sign in to GitHub; follow the directions to authenticate.
1. You should be good to go!

## In Class - Cloning a Repo

Cloning a repo is the process by which you download a repository to your computer so that you can work on them locally. This is a pretty simple process which the video below will explain

Simple, eh?
