## In class

Together, we will be working to create a set of class norms and expectations. In order to do so, I have created a new issue on [fcs-cs/cs2-student-files](https://www.github.com/fcs-cs/cs2-student-files) called [Classroom Norms and Expectations](https://github.com/fcs-cs/cs2-student-files/issues/12). Each student should contribute three comments to the discussion using the following template

Answer the following:

### Learning
- I **learn** best when: 
- So I want a classroom that is: 
- In order to achieve this, I propose the following classroom norm: 

### Contributing
- I **contribute** best when: 
- So I want a classroom that: 
- In order to achieve this, I propose the following classroom norm: 

### Expectations

(Please add only one for each expectation)
- I expect my teacher to:
- I expect my classmates to:
- I expect myself to:

## At Home
Each student is required to make 6 comments back to the issue in repsonse to other students. Please respond to 
- 2 student comments about learning norms
- 2 student comments aobut contributing norms
- 2 student comments about expections

Response comments should fall into one of the following categories.
- Noting similarities between differnent comments
- Noting potential conflicts between comments
- Noting areas that need further clarification

Responses should
- @mention individuals whose comments you are commenting on

The idea here is that were trying to drive the discussion towards a consensus. Be thoughtful, constructive and specific.
