## In class
- Create a new github repository called "Classes I'm currently taking"
- Create a new file called "current courses.txt"
- add each of your classes from **last semester** to the file and commit the change.
- edit the file to reflect the classes you are currently taking **this semester**
- commit those changes.
- If you finish early try making another .txt file see how far back you can remember your classes and work forward, committing changes for each semester.
